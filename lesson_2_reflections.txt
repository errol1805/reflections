What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git folder gets created. We need to initialize because it creates the metadata structure for version control in git to work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to only commit changes to specific files. This provides us with more flexibility.
