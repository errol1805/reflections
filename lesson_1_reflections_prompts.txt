How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It elped because if I didn't view the two versions of the file, I wouldn't have seen the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It would allow me to fall back to an older version of the file if I wished

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros: allows me to pick and choose when I want to store a version of the file.
Cons: I might forget to commit and not have that particular version of the file saved.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because Program codes often refer to other files within the same folder and we want to be able to comit a version of the entire folder.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log allows me to view the commit log oof the entire file. git diff allows me to check the differences between each version of the file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It would make me more confident because I know I can always go back to where I was before.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Storing the code from my previous projects on coursera
